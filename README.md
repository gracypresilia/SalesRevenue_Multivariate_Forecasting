# Retail Sales Data Monthly Multivariate Forecasting
This project focuses on forecasting monthly retail sales and revenue across multiple stores, product categories, and regions.
Before building forecasting models, the dataset undergoes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression analysis to identify key drivers and relationships among variables such as discounts, promotions, holidays, and online transactions.

## Process Overview
1. **Data Wrangling:** Gathered, assessed, and cleaned the raw datasets to ensure they are in a usable format. Find the raw data on [Kaggle: Synthetic Retail Sales Data 2022–2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamja/synthetic-retail-sales-data-20222024).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored the cleaned datasets to gain meaningful insights.
3. **Forecasting:** Predict future sales and revenue based on historical data. Determine the exogenous (regression) variables based on insights gained from previous step.

## Future Work
This project can be further enhanced by implementing the following ideas.
- Add deterministic seasonality to further reduce peak-month bias.
- Deploy a lightweight app for forecast testing.
- Automate monthly retraining and evaluation with updated data.
